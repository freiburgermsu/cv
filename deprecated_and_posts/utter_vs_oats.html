<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>This report contrasts the environmental impacts vegetarian and vegan dietary foods. The evaluation of eggs and milk in this study reveal that vegan alternatives, especially eggs, generally possess a lower environmental impact than vegetarian options.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Veganism is often less accommodated in society than the vegetarian diet. The dietary inconvenience may, however, be tolerable if significant reductions in environmental impact existed with veganism relative to vegetarianism. This report investigates the environmental impacts of dairy and eggs relative to their vegan alternatives, which may advise people with the relative importance of the foods while following a sustainable lifestyle.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p>The impact differences are presented in three sets of graphs. The impacts were calculated at different scales of the single serving size, which was 1 cup (245 grams) for the milks and 1 egg for both the chicken egg and the flax egg of <strong>Table 1</strong>. The graphs of <strong>Figures 1-3</strong> depict the impact differences from consuming single servings of each food in pure metric units of L, m<sup>2</sup>, and kg CO<sub>2</sub>-eq. The graphs of <strong>Figures 4-6</strong> depict the annual impacts from one daily serving in relatable units of filled bathtubs, city blocks, and km driven in a car. The graphs of <strong>Figures 7-9</strong> depict the impacts for consuming a retail container of each food, which is 4 liters for the milks and a dozen for the eggs, in relatable units.</p>

<p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<p>The calculated ranges were broad. Oatmilk, for example, required substantially <em>more</em> land than dairy milk while soymilk required substantially <em>less</em> land dairy milk. Soymilk further appears more sustainable than oatmilk by emitting less greenhouse gas emissions. The water and land impacts of oatmilk where greater than dairy milk, which may seem counterintuitive with vegan popular dogma, however, soymilk demonstrates that the exceptional impacts of oatmilk are unreflective of alternative milks in general. The impacts of water and land may furthermore be considered inferior to the impact of greenhouse gas emissions, in which case oatmilk may still be a more sustainable food than dairy milk. The flax egg was ubiquitously less impactful than the chicken egg, especially in reducing greenhouse gas emissions by ~30x.</p>
<p><strong>Methods </strong></p>
<p>Two environmental impact databases were used. The greenhouse gas and land emission data were sourced from a recent article in <em>Science</em><sup>1</sup>, where dairy milk, chicken egg, and soymilk foods were directly described. Oatmilk was approximated from the oatmeal category by the 043 (oats / oatmeal)<sup>i</sup> and by the 0.313 (oats / oatmeal)<sup>ii</sup> conversions that yielded a ratio between the quantity of oats in oatmeal and in oatmilk. The flax egg was approximated as “Other Pulses”. The water impact data was sourced from two recent studies<sup>2,3</sup> that directly summarized each food except oatmilk, which was calculated as the product from the water impact of oats and the proportion oats in oatmilk: 0.313.</p>
<p>The relatable values were acquired by various sources. The average bath size of 113 L was averaged from published literature<sup>4</sup> and colloquial values between <a href="https://sustainabilityinfo.com/water/how-much-water-does-a-faucet-use/">113 L</a> and <a href="https://www.onaverage.co.uk/consumption-averages/average-water-usage">115 L</a>. The CO<sub>2</sub>-eq emissions of driving was acquired from a 8.887 (kg CO2 / gallon gasoline) ratio by the EPA<sup>5</sup> and the assumption of a car with the fuel efficiency of 9 (L / 100 km) or 26 (miles / gallon). The land impact used a <a href="https://www.convertunits.com/from/square+city+blocks/to/hectare">conversion</a> of 1.544 (city blocks / hectare).</p>
