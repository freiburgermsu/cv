<strong>The vegan lifestyle</strong><sup>1</sup> improves <em>environmental sustainability</em><sup>2</sup>, <em>human health</em><sup>3</sup>, and <em>animal rights</em><sup>4</sup>. Vegan textiles achieve these ends by directly mitigating pollution and by indirectly displacing animal textiles<sup>5</sup> that are apart of the same animal industry that produces meat. The pollution of animal leather<sup>9</sup> from toxic chromium tanning<sup>10–14</sup> and other unsustainable practices like discarding 10-40% of hides for blemishes<sup>15</sup> define profound sustainable challenges for the leather industry<sup>16</sup>. The embodied greenhouse gas emission<sup>11,12</sup> of a single pair of leather shoes is equivalent to ~1 kg of meat<sup>2</sup>, while the leather industry<sup>17</sup>, which produces the equivalent of ~700 million jackets annually<sup>11,18,19</sup>, manifests in the CO2-eq emissions of some entire countries<sup>20</sup>.

<strong>Vegan textiles</strong> are emerging in every type of apparel. Notable vegan textile leaders like <em>Stella McCartney</em><sup>21</sup> and<em> Brave Gentlemen</em><sup>22</sup> are inspiring traditional clothing companies to adopt vegan options<sup>23,24</sup>. Vegan synthetic leather<sup>25</sup> is primarily composed of polyurethane<sup>26</sup> and polyvinyl chloride (PVC)<sup>27</sup>. Vegan leather can alternatively be sourced from biodegradable natural materials like bacterial cellulose<sup>28–30</sup>, fungi, and plant fibers, which are sampled in <strong>Table 1</strong>. Kombucha SCOBY is being explored by industry leaders like Suzanna Lee<sup>31,32</sup> of <em>Biofabricate</em><sup>33</sup> for clothing material. Banana fibers<sup>34</sup> and orange rines<sup>35</sup> have specifically developed faux silk, whereas corn fibers are processed into bedding<sup>36</sup>.

<strong>Vegan textiles</strong> will expand to supply the growing vegan population. The expanding demographic of vegans and animal-rights activists, especially after the zoonotic COVID-19 pandemic, will choose vegan alternatives for leathers, wools, and silks toward the vegan mission of <em>sustainability</em>, <em>health</em>, and <em>animal rights</em>.
