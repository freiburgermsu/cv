<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>A Thanksgiving meal is a terrific end to the calendar year. The meal selection, however, can profoundly influence your health, animal lives, and the environment. This study evaluates the health and sustainable implications of hypothetical omnivore and vegan meals.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p>The omnivorous and vegan meals of <strong>Tables 2 </strong>were evaluated. The environmental impact differences between the two meal alternatives, after consuming the meals every day for a year, are listed in <strong>Table 1</strong> with tangible units and are displayed in <strong>Figures 1-3</strong> with the pure impact quantities. The nutritional differences between the two meal alternatives were quantified in <strong>Table 3</strong> and <strong>Figures 4</strong> with USDA nutritional information, and then were compared with the daily USDA Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for a 31-50 year old woman (58 kg) and a 31-50 years old man (75 kg) in <strong>Tables 4-5</strong>, respectively. The omnivorous meals met 22 +\- 0 of the USDA targets for the man and met 26 +\- 3 targets for the woman while the vegan meals met 27 +\- 2 of the USDA targets for the man and met 30 +\- 2 targets for the woman.</p>

<p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<p>Beef is environmentally catastrophic. The drastic difference between omnivorous meal #1 and the other meals in each of <strong>Figures 1-3</strong> and in the large differences of Meals #1 in <strong>Table 1</strong> reflect the impact of a daily beef steak, even relative to the turkey in omnivorous meal #2. The omnivorous meals were consistently excessive with saturated fat and sodium, and deficient in omega 3 fatty acids, the minerals magnesium and manganese, and the vitamin folate. The vegan meals were consistently deficient in methionine and sodium.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The study confirms that beef is exceptionally impactful. The impact of white meat diets were comparably impactful to high legume vegan diets, although further analysis is necessary to reveal the subtler differences between the non-beef omnivorous and vegan diets. The nutritional profile of the vegan diets appears healthier than the omnivorous diets, although this study is unable to establish statistical significance for the results. Peer-reviewed literature should be sought for more rigorous comparisons with the vegan diet<sup>1,2</sup>.</p>
<p><strong>Methods </strong></p>
<p>The meals were adjusted to maintain equivalent nutrition. The two omnivorous meals and two vegan meals in <strong>Tables 2</strong> were quantitatively evaluated with USDA nutritional data from the <a href="https://nutritiondata.self.com/">https://nutritiondata.self.com/</a> website and were calorically balanced, despite that the omnivorous meals were inherently more concentrated with fat and protein since meat exclusively consists of fat and protein. Every meal attempted to reflect practical serving sizes while emphasizing foods in the databases.</p>
<p>Two environmental impact databases were used. The greenhouse gas and land emission data were sourced from a recent article in <em>Science</em> <sup>3</sup>. The database described general food categories like “Poultry” in lieu of specific foods like “white turkey meat”, which creates an approximate or average perspective of the dietary environmental impacts in this study. The water impact data was sourced from two recent studies<sup>4,5</sup> that summarize plant and animal foods with improved yet still approximate food specificity.</p>
<p>The tangible values of <strong>Table 2</strong> were converted by various sources. The average bath size was averaged from published literature of 105 L <sup>6</sup> and colloquial values of <a href="https://sustainabilityinfo.com/water/how-much-water-does-a-faucet-use/">113 L</a> and <a href="https://www.onaverage.co.uk/consumption-averages/average-water-usage">115 L</a>. The CO<sub>2</sub>-eq emissions of driving was acquired with a 8.887 (kg CO2 / gallon of gasoline) conversion value by the EPA<sup>7</sup>. The land was converted to city blocks with the unit <a href="https://www.convertunits.com/from/square+city+blocks/to/hectare">conversion</a> of 1.544 (city blocks / hectare).</p>
