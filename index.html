                    Andrew admires the natural world, and strives to protect and understand life. He personally advocates for veganism <!-- <a href="https://thesustainablevegan.org/veganism/">veganism</a> &amp;  -->
                    minimalism as personal habits that improve one's health and financial security, respectively, while altruistically conserving ecosystems and animal lives. He professionally researches 
                    technologies that extend these aspirations: e.g. improving the sustainability of society through seawater desalination, light-activated antibiotics, and plant replacements for petroleum; 
                    and elucidating the mysteries of biology through metabolic modeling that can foster synthetic biology and the rational design of biological solutions to challenges in sustainability and health.
