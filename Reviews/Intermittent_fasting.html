            <h1 class="header">Intermittent Fasting</h1>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                The simultaneous improvement of health and physique is often sought through exercise, however, sustained fasting can achieve the same goal without expending time or money. 
                A few dietary regimes have been devised to achieve mesh the benefits of fasting with the contemporary lifestyles.
            </p>
            <p>Caloric Restriction (CR) constrains the quantity of consumption to below one's metabolic rate.</p>
            <p>
                Ketogenic diets - such as the Atkins diet, a low-glycemic index diet, and a Medium Chain Triglycerides (MCT) diet - constrain the set of consumed foods to only those with low glycemic loads. 
                This regime maintains ketogenesis - the metabolic state during fasting - despite regular eating. These diets are clinically useful (especially in children) to treat or cure neurological 
                abnormalities<sup>1</sup>, yet, they are often deficient in calcium and B-complex.
            </p>
            <p>
                Intermittent fasting (IF), in contrast to the aforementioned fasting diets, constrains mealtimes to certain hours or days. This regime improves health to an equivalent or greater degree 
                than ketogenic diets<sup>2</sup> and caloric restriction<sup>3,4</sup> without compromising the quantity or identity of one's diet, and while notably maintaining nutritional status and 
                muscle mass<sup>5</sup>. These diets are moreover considered a safe<sup>6</sup> method of alleviating inflammation, optimizing physiology<sup>7</sup>, increasing cellular resilience<sup>8</sup> 
                to toxicity, and slowing metabolic ageing<sup>9</sup>.
            </p>

            <h2>Intermittent Fasting</h2>
            <p>
                A few IF diets can be practiced. The century old<sup>10</sup> 5-2 diet<sup>11</sup> consists of 2 non-consecutive fasting days with 5 calorically normal days each week. 
                This diet has extended the longevity of animals<sup>10</sup>. Hour-restricted IF diets specify windows of time each day in which consumption is permitted, which is famously 
                exemplified by Islamic Ramadan where consumption is permitted only when the sun is not out. This religious fast has been noted to improve lipoprotein concentrations<sup>12,13</sup>, 
                albeit at the sacrifice of sleep<sup>14</sup>. Other windows of time may be selected, such as the morning/midday<sup>15</sup> that better synchronizes with the circadian rhythm 
                and improves the microbiota profile<sup>16</sup>. The health benefits of IF are enumerated in the following sub-sections.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Diabetes and Metabolic Syndrome:</h3>
            <p>
                The metabolisms<sup>17</sup> and resting glucose and insulin concentrations<sup>4,5,18</sup> of diabetics were improved by time-restricted IF<sup>19</sup>, which was augmented by 
                the combination of CR<sup>15,20</sup>. IF and CR in combination is an effective method of specifically reducing visceral fat mass<sup>21</sup>, which is a prominent risk factor 
                for diabetes and metabolic syndrome.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Cardiovascular tone:</h3>
            <p>
                IF decreases resting blood pressure and heart rate<sup>22</sup> while improving physical recovery from heart attacks<sup>8</sup>. The cardio-protective benefits are supposed to 
                originate from the increased production of vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF)<sup>23</sup>.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Brain and neurology:</h3>
            <p>
                IF strengthens nerves against death from strokes and degenerative diseases like dementia<sup>24</sup>, Alzheimer's disease<sup>25</sup>, cognitive decline from age or infection<sup>24</sup>, 
                epilepsy<sup>2</sup> and traumatic brain injury<sup>1</sup> (comparable to the results of ketogenic diets), and Huntington's disease<sup>11</sup>. The neuroprotective benefits of IF may derive 
                from increase production of Brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF)<sup>23</sup>, which stimulates neurological growth and recovery.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The systemic benefits and noted safety of IF suggests that this dietary practice may be a convenient means of improving health and wellbeing without compromising comfort foods.</p>
