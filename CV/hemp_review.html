            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>
                Hemp is becoming a cornerstone crop in many regions of the U.S.A. The burgeoning hemp economy presents a timely opportunity for agriculturalists and researchers 
                in the Tobacco country of the American Southeast to replace tobacco, which has withered in the past few decades, with hemp as the cash crop for the 21<sup>st</sup> century. 
                This review details <em>Cannabis</em> biochemistry and the processing technologies that yield final hemp products within the context of global and American markets. The 
                analytical discussion is further contextualized with recent fervor for <em>Cannabis </em>products that has ignited <em>Cannabis</em> decriminalization throughout the country, 
                after a century of sociopolitical stigmas and prohibition. This review provides a unique perspective of the blossoming hemp economy while seeking to urge and inspire 
                agriculturalists and researchers of the American Southeast to seize the opportunity of replacing tobacco with hemp as the 21<sup>st</sup> century cash crop.

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <h3><em>Cannabis sativa</em></h3>
            <p>
                <em>Cannabis</em> is recapturing its popular fixation as a wonder crop. The natively Eurasian genus <sup>1,2</sup> has provided societies with fiber, food, and medicine since at 
                least 2700 B.C.E. <sup>3</sup> and possibly since before 8000 B.C.E <sup>4</sup>. This versatile crop consists of distinct species in <strong>Figure 1</strong><sup>5</sup> whose 
                qualities have different applications. <em>Cannabis</em> <em>sativa L. </em>is "hemp" that is used for food, fiber, and medicine. <em>Cannabis indica </em>is "marijuana" that 
                is used for medicine, recreation, and ceremony <sup>6</sup>. These two distinct species, however, are often mistaken for each other, which has been detrimental to hemp agriculture over the past century.
            </p>
            <p>
                The tarnishing of <em>Cannabis</em> and Hemp began with the Reefer Madness campaign of 1936. The campaign unfortunately vilified all <em>Cannabis</em> products including hemp as 
                being hallucinogenic agents that inspire violent crime. The Marijuana Tax Act of 1937 quickly followed popular dismay from the Reef Madness campaign, where all <em>Cannabis </em>operations, 
                including innocuous hemp farms, were rendered financially impractical and thus cultivation gradually subsided <sup>7</sup>. The financial constraints were lifted only once during 
                World War II <sup>8,9</sup> when the American military became in desperate need of hemp fibers after the Japanese military seized friendly hemp farms in the Pacific <sup>10</sup>. 
                The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) of 1970 initiated the infamous war on drugs which made the mere use or possession of any <em>Cannabis</em> varieties, including non-psychedelic 
                hemp<sup>11</sup>, a high felony, and which has exacerbated social tensions in the US justice system <sup>12</sup>. The CSA defines <em>Cannabis</em> in the highest classification as a 
                Schedule 1 substance, yet, perplexingly, Schedule 1 substances must by definition lack medicinal value and <em>Cannabis</em> possesses numerous medical uses like medical marijuana and 
                in prescription drugs (more in section <strong><em>Female Flower</em></strong>) <sup>13</sup>. These legal policies, nevertheless, have maligned attitudes of <em>Cannabis</em> both 
                domestically and internationally; for example, the Italian hemp cultivation plummeted from 135,000 hectares to 150 hectares during the 20<sup>th</sup> century <sup>14</sup>.

            <h3><em>Legislation</em></h3>
            <p>
                Hemp is now crucially being differentiated from marijuana and thus liberated from limitations <sup>15</sup>. Varying degrees of <em>Cannabis</em> declassification have occurred 
                in all but 6 American states <sup>16</sup>, in spite of the federal Schedule 1 classification <sup>17</sup>, and federal law now recognizes hemp as distinct from marijuana after 
                the US Agricultural Act of 2014 and in the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 <sup>18</sup>:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                The term "hemp" means the plant Cannabis sativa L. and any part of that plant, including the seeds thereof and all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and 
                salts of isomers, whether growing or not, with a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol [THC] concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                This momentum and growing awareness of hemp is even inspiring federal proposals to protect the <em>Cannabis</em> domestic economy through the SAFE act <sup>19</sup> 
                and the CLAIM act <sup>20</sup>, and to declassify all <em>Cannabis</em> products through the MORE act <sup>21</sup>. Recreational declassification and <em>Cannabis</em> 
                reform may be especially eminent with the recent Democratic sweep of the Legislative and Executive federal branches in the 2020 election, and with growing bipartisan support 
                of <em>Cannabis</em> <sup>22</sup>. We believe that this pivotal embrace for hemp and <em>Cannabis</em> products, in tandem with expanding consumer demand <sup>23</sup> 
                and a domestic aptitude for cash crops in the following discourse, will fuel the American hemp renaissance of the 21<sup>st</sup> century.
            </p>

            <h3><em>Tobacco Country</em></h3>
            <p>
                Hemp may be an agent of economic repair to the American Tobacco country. The tobacco country of the American Southeast, which includes Kentucky, Virginia, 
                Tennessee, and especially North Carolina <sup>24</sup>, enriched with the tobacco industry: e.g. Duke University and Duke energy in North Carolina were funded 
                by James Buchanan Duke <sup>25</sup> who industrialized the cigarette rolling machine <sup>26</sup>. These states have unfortunately also decayed with the American 
                tobacco industry, where 20<sup>th</sup> century medical research <sup>27-30</sup> fueled the indictment of tobacco companies <sup>31</sup> and marred domestic 
                tobacco consumerism <sup>32,33</sup>. Recent international growth in tobacco consumption is moreover sheltered from domestic tobacco industry by international 
                tariffs <sup>34</sup>, which compounds the economic hardship. The North Carolinian tobacco workforce has, for example, decreased by 56% between 1992-2012 <sup>35</sup> 
                and the quantity of North Carolinian tobacco farms plummeted by 95% between 1954-2012 <sup>36</sup>. The regional consequence is that skilled farmers, industrial 
                infrastructure, and knowledgeable business people are idle without a profitable cash crop.
            </p>
            <p>
                Progressive tobacco farmers have transitioned to cultivating hemp. These successful transitions from tobacco to hemp are documented in Kentucky <sup>37,38</sup> 
                and Tennessee <sup>39,40</sup>, and are inspiring agriculturalists across former Tobacco country to explore hemp as an emerging cash crop. Kentucky was once the 
                epicenter of American hemp during the turn of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, and, although these hemp genetics have disappeared <sup>10,41</sup> except for remnants 
                in the wild <sup>42,43</sup>, robust hemp genetics for the American Southeast can be recreated through cloning and genetic engineering technologies that are 
                available to growers today. The agronomic benefits of growing hemp are also pronounced <sup>44-48</sup>, which provides an additional utility to new hemp growers 
                as a valuable rotation crop as well as a cash crop.
            </p>
            <p>
                State legislatures are anticipating and supporting the agricultural transition. The North Carolina legislature recently established a commission to investigate 
                whether a portion of the estimated $5 billion of domestic hemp revenue by 2027 <sup>49</sup> can be claimed by the North Carolinian state economy <sup>50</sup>. 
                The Virginian legislature has recently decriminalized <em>Cannabis</em> and will legalize recreational marijuana <sup>51</sup>, which will invite the <em>Cannabis</em> 
                industry to establish in Virginia and will challenge the rest of Tobacco country to follow their lead. These recent actions establish favorable precedence for 
                hemp in Tobacco country that may continue to reverberate through the region and predictably inspire resident agriculturalists to join the movement by replacing 
                tobacco with hemp. The American Southeast appears to be recognizing the redeeming potential of hemp for the region's agricultural sector that is in dire need of a cash crop.
            </p>


            <h2>The Hemp Economy</h2>
            <p>
                This review, in addition to sociopolitical events, will survey the science and economy of hemp. The scope complements reviews by Amaducci et al.<sup>52</sup> and 
                Small et al.<sup>53</sup> by emphasizing hemp products and economic prospects, and by geographically contextualizing the discussion within the American Southeast. 
                Hemp products are generally sex-dependent, where males produce seeds and fine fibers while females produce flower buds and coarse fibers<sup>54</sup>, and thus the 
                following sections briefly articulate each product category <sup>55,56</sup>. We believe that the collective value of these products justify the pivotal role of 
                hemp as an agricultural cash crop in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.
            </p>

            <h3><em>Female Flower</em></h3>
            <p>
                The female hemp flower bud is a biochemical cornucopia. The flower bud is the source of naturopathic hemp and CBD oils, and of <em>Cannabis</em> smoking products. 
                The chemical proportions of the flower bud oil are influenced by the extraction method <sup>57,58</sup>, although, the flower oil extracts invariably contain 
                medicinal chemicals like sterols, fragrant terpenes <sup>59,60</sup>, cannabinoids, and cannflavins <sup>61</sup>. This diverse assemblage of chemicals <sup>58</sup> 
                in hemp flower oils is renowned for exerting an "entourage effect" <sup>62-64</sup>, where the medicinal effects of the complete hemp extract <sup>65</sup> are 
                greater than the isolated effects of each contributing chemical; nevertheless, each chemical of the extracted entourage has distinct medicinal value. The sterol 
                &beta;-sitosterol, for example, can remedy prostate enlargement and can be chemopreventive<sup>66</sup>. The most prevalent terpenes in <em>Cannabis</em> are limonene 
                that is common in citrus fruits and mycrene that is common in thyme and hops, which are depicted in <strong>Figure 2</strong>. Limonene is chemoprotective and 
                chemotherapeutic<sup>67,68</sup>, and dissolves gallstones in vivo <sup>69</sup>. Myrcene, by contrast, is hepatoprotective <sup>70</sup>, prevents genetic damage 
                <sup>71</sup>, and attenuates osteoarthritis <sup>72</sup>. Cannabinoids are the quintessential medicinal extract from <em>Cannabis </em><sup>73-75</sup>, which 
                constitute a diverse set of &gt; 60 cannabinoids <sup>60</sup> in numerous chemical classes, which are sampled in <strong>Figure 3</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The effects of the cannabinoids primarily originate from the endocannabinoid system. The endocannabinoid system <sup>76</sup> is defined by the network of CB1 
                and CB2 receptors throughout the body, and particularly in the nervous system. The endocannabinoid system is involved in myriad physiological phenomena like dementia 
                and Parkinson's Disease <sup>77</sup>, and also like the fabled "runner's high" <sup>78</sup>. The CBC cannabinoid class <sup>79</sup> from <strong>Figure 3</strong> 
                is anti-inflammatory <sup>80,81</sup> and selectively stimulates CB2 receptors <sup>82</sup>. The psychedelic cannabinoid class THC from marijuana stimulates CB1 
                receptors in the nervous system <sup>83</sup>, which ignites hunger and attenuates nausea. These physiological effects of THC cannabinoids are used medicinally 
                in the drugs dronabinol, nabilone, and marinol <sup>84-86</sup>. The economically emerging cannabinoid class CBD <sup>87</sup> from hemp stimulates both nervous 
                CB1 receptors and bodily CB2 receptors <sup>88</sup>, which simultaneously attenuates inflammation <sup>89</sup> and normalizes the nervous system. The latter 
                attribute is used medicinally in the drug Epidiolex <sup>90</sup> to treat epilepsy.

            <h3><em>Male Hempseeds</em></h3>
            <p>
                Hempseeds are a diverse hemp product. Hempseeds may be used as a hearty 21<sup>st</sup> century food, which are well aligned with progressive trends towards 
                hypoallergenic <sup>91,92</sup> and plant-based proteins. The protein of hempseeds is both readily digestible<sup>93</sup> and contains a complete amino acid 
                profile <sup>94</sup>, which are favorable attributes for healthful eating. The plant protein market was valued at $9.7 billion in 2020 and is estimated to 
                reach $13.8 billion by 2026 <sup>95</sup>, which is fueled by the consumer migration toward vegetarianism and veganism <sup>96</sup> that already describe 
                ~21% of the global population <sup>97</sup> . Hempseeds may further be a source of industrious oil. Hempseed oil is nutritionally unrivalled for possessing 
                ~85-90% (w/w) omega-6 and omega-3 essential fatty acids in the optimum 3:1 ratio, while additionally containing the rare GLA and SDA fatty acids <sup>94</sup> 
                that can alleviate eczema after dietary consumption <sup>98</sup>. Hempseed oil also possesses nutraceutical chemicals <sup>99</sup>, like polyphenols 
                <sup>100</sup>. Hempseed oil can moreover be used as an alternative resource for biodiesel <sup>101</sup> and oilseed biomass <sup>102</sup>. Hempseeds are 
                presently the most profitable of all hemp products <sup>41</sup>
            </p>
            
            <h3><em>Fiber</em></h3>
            <p>
                Hemp is a more sustainable fiber source than trees or other fiber crops. Hemp requires 2-3 orders of magnitude less time to mature than trees and hemp 
                possesses ~1/3 less lignin <sup>103</sup> than trees, which permit hemp fiber to be more efficiently processed in industry. Hemp fibers may furthermore 
                be processed with the same industrial infrastructure as conventional wood sources <sup>104</sup>, which facilitates drop-in substitutions of wood fibers 
                with hemp fibers. Hemp in <strong>Table 1</strong> is also more resource efficient than other fiber crops, and especially 1<sup>st</sup> generation biomass 
                crops <sup>105</sup> that are critiqued for displacing food from hungry people <sup>106</sup>. Hemp generally deters most pests <sup>107</sup> via inherent insecticidal 
                properties <sup>108</sup> and thus hemp requires minimal applications of pesticides, whereas conventional textile fibers like cotton can require ~76 million pounds 
                of pesticides annually <sup>109</sup>. Hemp is evidently an efficient crop that may become a critical feedstock for the emerging bioeconomy <sup>110,111</sup>, 
                which will mitigate Anthropocene <sup>112-116</sup> and climate change <sup>117-119</sup> and the deleterious effects of these phenomena <sup>120-126</sup>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hemp fibers are categorized into bast fibers and hurd fibers. Hemp bast fibers are exceptionally long and strong from an unusually high cellulosic content 
                relative to hardwoods, softwoods, and other fiber crops <sup>127-129</sup>. Hemp hurd fibers, by contrast<strong>,</strong> are of average quality, yet, 
                they are notably hydrophilic. These fibers are contrasted in <strong>Figure 2</strong> and <strong>Table 2</strong>. The different fiber qualities manifest 
                in the distinct uses for each fiber, which are described in the following subsections.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Bast Fibers</h4>
            <p>
                Hemp bast fibers are the original hemp fiber resource and are extraordinarily industrious. The highly cellulosic fiber have produced a range of products between 
                cordage<sup>9</sup> and textiles<sup>49</sup> since antiquity. Contemporary demand for hemp bast fiber is rekindling from the wave of awareness for sustainable 
                resources like hemp <sup>130</sup>. The influential American companies Patagonia <sup>131</sup> and Xero <sup>132</sup>, for example, are blending hemp with their 
                conventional materials in new sustainable product lines <sup>133</sup>. These trend-setting movements may inspire an industry adoption of hemp fiber to meet the apprehended future textile demands.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hemp bast fibers are the quintessential pulp and paper resource. The original paper millennia ago was created from hemp bast fibers<sup>134-136</sup>, and the 
                long cellulosic fibers are still a favorable paper resource for being tear resistant and extraordinarily strong <sup>127</sup>. The economic prowess of the 
                modern pulp and paper industry <sup>137</sup> provides ample opportunity for hemp agriculturalists to acquire steady profit through hemp bast fibers. The global 
                revenue of container cartoons alone, which is within the packaging materials sector of the pulp and paper industry <sup>138</sup>, is $22 billion <sup>139</sup>. 
                The American graphic and writing papers sector of the pulp and paper industry is &gt;$96 billion <sup>140</sup>, and the global tissues sector <sup>141</sup> of the 
                pulp and paper industry is &gt;$70 billion <sup>142</sup> . These large and expanding pulp and paper sectors <sup>143</sup>, when coupled with the industrial 
                shift towards mitigating deforestation <sup>144</sup>, converge on using hemp bast fibers as a resource that uniquely satisfies both the need for a cellulose fiber 
                and the desire for a sustainable resource.

            <h4>Hurd Fibers</h4>
            <p>
                Hemp hurd fibers (shives) are affordable and hydrophilic. The hydrophilicity of hemp hurds is useful for absorptive materials <sup>162</sup> like animal bedding 
                <sup>137</sup>, cements <sup>163,164</sup>, and tissue and towel paper products <sup>165</sup>. The affordability of hemp hurds encourages their application as a 
                2<sup>nd</sup> generation alternative feedstock <sup>166</sup> in producing platform materials <sup>103</sup> and biofuels <sup>167</sup>. The already large demand 
                for biofuels <sup>168</sup> will increase as oil reserves dissipate in this century <sup>169</sup> and as governments incentivize <sup>170</sup> biofuels <sup>171-173</sup> 
                toward achieving their low carbon emission goals <sup>174</sup>. The affordable hemp hurd fibers can be applied in biocomposites materials <sup>175-177</sup> like 
                hemp/polyester <sup>178</sup>, hemp/polypropylene <sup>179</sup>, and hemp/epoxy <sup>180</sup> blends. These blends are preferred over conventional plastics <sup>181,182</sup> 
                for minimizing plastic pollution <sup>184-187</sup>and for being more affordable and lighter without sacrificing strength <sup>183</sup>. Hemp hurds may also be a more 
                affordable alternative to hemp bast fibers <sup>188</sup> in creating nanocellulose fibrils <sup>189,190</sup>, which offer unique material properties in bioactive and 
                electrolytic applications <sup>191</sup> as two of many examples <sup>192</sup>.
            </p>

            <h4>Hurd and Bast Fiber Separation</h4>
            <p>
                Hemp bast and hurd fibers can only be used after they are separated from each other. This separation process remains the greatest challenge of utilizing hemp fibers 
                and is an active area of research. Retting is the centuries old method of liberating hurd and bast fibers <sup>193,194</sup> through decomposing the polymeric integument 
                that binds the bast and hurd fibers together. Traditional retting exploits soil microbes <sup>195</sup> and morning dew <sup>196</sup> to cultivate biodegradation of the 
                natural integument. Industrial retting controls the decomposition conditions <sup>197</sup> and adds complementary chemical additives <sup>198-201</sup> that can expedite 
                the degradation <sup>202,203</sup> or can improve the sustainability of the process <sup>204</sup>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Decortication separates hemp fibers either after, or in lieu of, retting <sup>205</sup>. Decortication mechanically separates the bast and the hurd fibers from hemp 
                <sup>206,207</sup> via normal or pinning methods <sup>208</sup>. The former method processes each hemp stalk in a single pass while the latter method repeatedly inserts 
                and withdraws each hemp stalk from the decorticator as a means of straightening the fiber. Mechanical alternatives to decortication include hammer-milling <sup>209</sup> 
                and ball-milling <sup>210</sup>, which use hammers or metallic balls respectively to pulverize the integument of the hemp stalks and thereby liberate the two hemp fiber 
                types from each other. Decortication protocols are being improved <sup>211,212</sup>, which may gradually popularize the process as a means of preparing hemp fibers for 
                textiles <sup>213</sup> and other fibrous applications.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Fiber Pulping</h4>
            <p>
                The separated fibers can be processed in pulp and paper industry through myriad means. The chemical and physical pulping methods for hemp are sampled in <strong>Table 3</strong>, 
                although, physical and chemical treatments are often combined in practice for greater efficacy. The ubiquitous Kraft pulping process <sup>214-216</sup> is notably effective 
                with hemp fibers <sup>217,218</sup>, yet, the hydroxide concentration must be balanced to prevent the excessive hydroxide from deteriorating the fiber quality <sup>179</sup>. 
                Steam treatments <sup>219,220</sup> and combinations of steam with the Kraft process <sup>221</sup> are also efficacious.
            </p>
            <p>
                A few green chemistry methods are also being explored in hemp fiber treatment. One method is autohydrolysis, where heated water depolymerizes polysaccharides like hemicellulose 
                <sup>222,223</sup> and therefore primes the fiber for further biorefinery. Another method replaces caustic bleaching agents with mild carbonate solutions <sup>224</sup>. These 
                green chemistry methods are appealing for future research as both benign and sustainable means for accessing hemp fibers.

            <h2>Hemp country</h2>
            <p>
                The American Southeast is graced with hemp as a replacement cash crop for tobacco. The multitude of hemp products that span medicine, fiber, and food offer abundant 
                economic opportunity for agricultural and industrial entrants to profit through the 21<sup>st</sup> century from the burgeoning hemp economy. These economic opportunities 
                are furthermore experiencing political tailwinds, which may climax in this Democratic 2021-2023 congressional cycle with the legalization of recreational marijuana in the 
                federal and state governments. The alignment of consumer fervor for sustainable and healthy products, the underutilized aptitude for cultivating cash crops in the American 
                Southeast, and the political sentiments of this decade will billow the hemp industry through the foreseeable future into a noteworthy agricultural renaissance. The Tobacco 
                country of the American Southeast may soon become known as Hemp country.
